The Graph shows the output of RNA-seuencing. The blue lines are ATAC results, while, reds are RNAseq and greens are open chromatin regions. 
From the screen shot you can see the that where we have genes expressed, the RNA has also been produced and they almost overlap with each other. This is confirmed by open chromatin regions. When chromatins are open, it indicates that a gene is being transcribed and RNA is produced. Therefore, this also has an overlap with peaks that are visualized in the screenshot. 
Next thing to notice is the annotation at the bottom of the screenshot. This is showed in purple and it visulizes promoteres, exons and introns since the genome that we'e visulizing belongs to an eukaryotes. The thinest lines that connects the blocks are introns. The thine line at beginning is the promoter region and the boxes are exons.
